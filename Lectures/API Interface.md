## API (Application Programming Interface)

An **API** allows one software to use the features or data of another software by sending requests for specific functionalities.

### Using Others’ APIs
- Example: To use **Google Maps**, we integrate its API to access map features.  
- Similarly, **JazzCash’s API** allows apps to process payments.  
- Some APIs have free usage limits; exceeding them may require payment.

### Selling Your Own API
- You can **create and sell** your own APIs for others to use.  
- Providing just the API costs less; offering a complete app or service costs more.

### Development Requirements
- To use **C#**, you need a **C# compiler**.  
- For **TypeScript**, install **Node.js**.  
- **JavaScript** can run directly in browsers since they have a built-in **NodeJS-like environment**.
